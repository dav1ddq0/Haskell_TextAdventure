### Abstract

At the top of a mountain in Dhaka a desolate traveler sees an
object of strange value when suddenly a mysterious portal
opens in front of him that leads to the daconic world of
Fireblood. A mysterious force pushes him and he appears
suddenly in an unexpected room of the same.

### Requirements

Version of the compiler used:  ```GHCi, version 8.6.5```

#### Note

To parse the input a library is used that is sometimes not installed. This library is Data.List.Split which has many functions that are used to parse the inputs.

So if you don't have it installed, we recommend you install it from the official website [Split](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split).
